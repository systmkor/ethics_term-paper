Tor helps to reduce the risks of both simple and sophisticated traffic analysis
by distributing your transactions over several places on the Internet, so no
single point can link you to your destination. The idea is similar to using a
twisty, hard-to-follow route in order to throw off somebody who is tailing you â€”
and then periodically erasing your footprints. Instead of taking a direct route
from source to destination, data packets on the Tor network take a random
pathway through several relays that cover your tracks so no observer at any
single point can tell where the data came from or where it's going.

To create a private network pathway with Tor, the user's software or client
incrementally builds a circuit of encrypted connections through relays on the
network. The circuit is extended one hop at a time, and each relay along the way
knows only which relay gave it data and which relay it is giving data to. No
individual relay ever knows the complete path that a data packet has taken. The
client negotiates a separate set of encryption keys for each hop along the
circuit to ensure that each hop can't trace these connections as they pass
through.
