Once a circuit has been established, many kinds of data can be exchanged and
several different sorts of software applications can be deployed over the Tor
network. Because each relay sees no more than one hop in the circuit, neither an
eavesdropper nor a compromised relay can use traffic analysis to link the
connection's source and destination. Tor only works for TCP streams and can be
used by any application with SOCKS support.

For efficiency, the Tor software uses the same circuit for connections that
happen within the same ten minutes or so. Later requests are given a new
circuit, to keep people from linking your earlier actions to the new ones.
