\section{Facts} 

\subsection{Iran's Presidential Election}

In Iran, the sparks of political unrest began to fly in the summer of 2009.
Friction started with the highly anticipated outcome of the Iran's race for
presidency. Elections took place on June 12th. To the surprise of many, Mahmoud
Ahmadinajad won with a lanslide victory of well above 60\% of the vote
\cite{TheIranianVote, IranianElectionResultsByProvince}, making this
Ahmadinjad's second term as the President of Iran.

\subsection{The Response}

Iranian citizens and many others were outraged with the results of the election.
Laura Secor, from the New Yorker, succinctly sumed up the voice of the people by
stating \begin{quotation} there can be no question that on June 12, 2009, the Iranian
presidential election was stolen. \cite{TheIranianVote}\end{quotation} Citizens
swiftly began to vocalize their opinions.

\subsection{Protests Begin}

Protests began on June 13 and picked up force not only offline but online as
well. By the fifth day of protests, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to
the streets of Tehran in opposition of the election's outcome
\cite{IranProtestsFifthDayOfUnrest}. At the same time, ``the
Twitterverse\footnote{Twitterverse is a name referring everything relating to
the social network Twitter.} exploded with tweets from people who weren't having
it, both in English and in Farsi.'' \cite{WhyTwitterIsTheMedium}

\subsection{Iran Tries to Stop the Protests}

Iran's government tried to douse out the dissent. The government's approach was
to have an all around black out of information and organization. They sent
Revolutionary Gaurds into the streets, cut off the Internet, and shut down
cell-phone communications. \cite{TheIranianVote} The government didn't stop
there, they began to specifically arresting, ``at least 500 activitsts,
opposition figures, journalists.'' \cite{IranProtestsFifthDayOfUnrest} The
government didn't stop with just arrest they made certain locations of protest a
threat to life, one such location was the Interior Ministry \footnote{The
Interior Ministry was the part of the Iranian government that tallied the votes
of the election}. The government publicly announced that the police had orders
to shoot anyone approaching the Interior Ministry. \cite{TheIranianVote} Online,
the government filtered their internet traffic and for periods of times blocked
social networks like Twitter \footnote{Twitter is a microblogging service were
anyone can read, write, and share messages, up to 140 characters long.
\cite{WhatIsTwitter}}. \cite{IranBlocksFacebookTwitter}

%%TWITTER FOOTNOTE - add source from "What is Twitter, a social network or a
%% News media
\subsection{The Role of Internet}

The Internet provided a medium for political discorse where traditional media
was failing. Blogs and social networks, especially Twitter, began to prove
thereself invaluabale.  Where traditional means of sharing informations such as
newspapers were breaking down, these sources of information were playing a vital
role during the protests by providing a global, uncensored, and near real-time
means of news, communication, and organization.  In Iran, ``while the front
pages of Iranian newspapers were full of blank space where censors had
whited-out news stories, Twitter was delivering information from street level,
in real time.'' \cite{WhyTwitterIsTheMedium}

\subsection{Citizens use Tor to Bypass Censorship}

With the government filtering out vital lifelines of information and means of
organization, citizens began to find alternatives to connect to Twitter. One of
the tools that proved useful was Tor.

\subsection{What is Tor}

Tor\footnote{In this paper when the term `Tor' is used it will refer to the
software} is software that connects and participates in the Tor network that
provides users a means way of connecting with websites that is encrypted and
anonymous. From Tor's website under a page about the the 'Users of Tor' they
state that, ``Tor was origianlly designed, implemented and deployed as a
third-generation onion routing project of the Naval Research Laboratory...
Today, it is used every day for a wide variety of purposes by the military,
journalists, law enofrcement officers, activists, and many others.

\subsection{Iran Blocks Tor}

Two years after Iran is still under the same regime of Ahmadinajad.  On
September 14, 2011 the Iranian government added a filter rule to their firewall
and blocked Tor traffic despite Tors main focused intent on preventing such
things from ever happening. \cite{IranBlocksTorSameDayFix}  Later that day the
Tor project released a patch which circumvent Iran's firewall filters and
suggested users of Tor to upgrade to version Tor 0.2.2.33 or Tor 0.2.3.4-alpha.
\cite{IranBlocksTorSameDayFix}

%%% Research Question %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Research Question} 
Was it ethical for the Tor project to release a same day patch specifically
enabling Iranians to bypass Iran's firewall when the government explicitely
filtered Tor traffic starting September 14, 2011.

\subsection{Importance of Question}

The Internet, blogs, and social networks have proven to play a critical role in
Iranian political discorse at least for the past 3 years. With Iran's government
strive to squander any form of freedom of expression or press by force both on-
and off-line has only hightened the need for a means to safely, privately, and
without restriction to communicate online. The Tor project strives to make Tor
able to provide such services to the world and in this case specifically to aid
Iranians. There project and focused reason to patch their software could have
grave implications for Iranian users.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% Extant Arguments from External Sources %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Extant Arguments} 

There have virtually been no published articles specifically finding the Tor's
patch in response to Iran's Tor block ethical or not.

\subsection{Arguments For Tor}

Tor in general has been considerd for good of humanity, giving users right to
privacy while using the Internet \cite{TorCreatesSaferInternet, TorLastHope}.
The Tor project has even been given The Free Software Foundation Award of 2010
for 
\begin{quotation}Tor has enabled roughly 36 million people around the world
  to experience freedom of access and expression on the Internet while keeping
  them in control of their privacy and anonymity. Its network has proved pivotal 
  in dissident movements in both Iran and more recently Egypt.\cite{FreeSoftwareAwards}
\end{quotation}

%%people don't find tor EVIL

%%3rd parties think the censorship is bad

\subsection{Arguments Against Tor}

The Iranian government has and currently firmly believes that it is necessary to
censor the Internet traffic coming in and out of the country. It has been
announced one reason why they feel that is right to censor is because they feel
they need to stamp out ``immoral and illegal'' content
\cite{CensorshipFearsRise}.

In specific regard it is probably safe to assume that the Iranian government
finds Tor to be unethical since it allows people to bypass what they consider to
be necessary Internet filters and since the Iranian government has specifically
blocked Tor\cite{IranBlocksTorSameDayFix}.


\subsection{Arguments Summary}

To summarize, it is a common belief that Tor is ethical because it allows to
people to search anonymously. Iranian government finds Tor unethical and has
taken measure filter Tor traffic.

\section{Analysis}

\subsection{Why the SE Code of Ethics Applies} 

The Software Engineering Code of Ethics states that, ``Software engineers are
those who contribute by direct participation or by teaching, to the analysis,
specification, design, development, certification, maintenance and testing of
software systems.'' \cite{SE:CodeOfEthics} The Tor Project is a 501(c)(3)
non-profit based in the United States that makes internet anonymity
software.\cite{Tor:FAQ, Tor:CorePeople} The Tor Project publicizes that, ``The
Tor software is a program you can run on your computer that helps keep you safe
on the Internet.''\cite{Tor:FAQ} 

\begin{quotation}
  The Corporation is organized and shall be operated exclusively for scientific,
  charitable and educational purposes within the meaning of section 501(c)(3) of
  the Internal Revenue Code, including (a) to develop, improve and distribute
  free, publicly available tools and programs that promote free speech, free
  expression, civic engagement and privacy rights online; (b) to conduct
  scientific research regarding, and to promote the use of and knowledge about,
  such tools, programs and related issues around the world; (c) to educate the
  general public around the world about privacy rights and anonymity issues
  connected to Internet use.
  \cite{TOR:Sponsorship}
\end{quotation}
  
Because the Tor Project creates and distributes
software this means they, ``contribute by direct participation ...  to the
analysis, specification, design, development, ... , maintenance and testing of
software systems'' and thus are Software Engineers means that The Tor Project
falls under the requirements of the Software Engineering Code of
Ethics.\cite{Tor:FAQ, Tor:Overview} 


\subsection{SE Code 3.03}

\fbox{ 
  \parbox{0.8\linewidth}{ 
    3.03. ... Address \textbf{ethical}, \textbf{economic}, (and)
    \textbf{cultural}, ... issues related to \textbf{work projects}.
    \cite{SE:CodeOfEthics}
}}
\newline

To bring this ethical argument into domain of the Tor Project
aiding Iranian dicicdents a few modifications to the code need to be made. The
\textbf{ethical} issue in this case is the issue of \textbf{freedom of
expression}. The \textbf{economic} issues in this case is the issue of
\textbf{Tor software's financial cost} (i.e. the financial cost on the users of
the software). The \textbf{cultural} issues in this case is refering to
\textbf{Iran's oppression of online dissidents}. The phrase \textbf{work projects} in
this case referes to \textbf{Tor software}.

%The Tor software is a \textbf{work project} that has identified, defined, and
%addressed is to directly project directly concerned its software with the one of
%its hopes to provide, ``Journalists use Tor to communicate more safely with
%whistleblowers and dissidents.

\subsubsection{Applying SE Code 3.03 to the Tor Project}

\fbox{
  \parbox{0.8\linewidth}{
    3.03. ... Address \textbf{freedom of expression},
    \textbf{Tor's financial cost}, (and) \textbf{Iran's oppression of dissidents},
    ... issues related to \textbf{Tor software}.  
    \cite{SE:CodeOfEthics}
}}
\newline

Our question now can be broken up into four parts. First, does Tor software
promote freedom of expression in Iran? Second, what is the financial cost for
Tor users?  Third, does Tor software mitigate Iran's oppression of dissidents?
Lastly, is Tor ethical under SE code 3.03.

\subsubsection{The state of Freedom of Expression in Iran}
Before we investigate wether Tor addresses freedom of expression in Iran we need
to examine what the current sate of freedom of expression is in Iran. 

\paragraph{Freedom of Expression Definition}

For analysis of this paper we will need define `freedom of expression' somewhat
broadly. It will be synonymsous with freedom of expression, speech, opinion, and
press.  This needs to be the case because of the nature that the Internet,
social networks and blogs have played in this case. The foundation of this
redefintion of `freedom of expression' stems from 
\begin{quotation} 
  A free press is defined not only by the media's freedom to say what they want
  but also by media consumers' freedom to get the information they need.
  \cite{PublicAttitudeTowardFreedomPress, ComplexRoadToHappiness}
\end{quotation}

In addition we need note that the terms `media' and `media consumers' from the
quote above in our case need to include to the people who post content and read
content from blogs, Twitter, social networks, and other forms of communication
online since the importance of these forms of medium have played in Iran but in
addition to that for example Twitter has been shown to show accurate news
events.  \cite{Twitter:BreakingNewsDetection, Twitter:IdentificationLiveEvents,
Twitter:MeasuringInfluence}


\paragraph{Universal Declaration of Human Rights}

We should examine Iran's relationship to the United Nations to temper our
analysis of there actions in how they cesnor their citizens. 

(how it applies to under 3.03 code entry and how it is means to guide goals of
the state.)

Iran is and has been a member of the United Nations since 1945.
\cite{UN:IranBecameMember, UN:IranActiveMember} Under the United Nations `The
Universal Declaration of Human Rights' it states that ``...  Member States have
pledged themselves to achieve, in co-operation with the United Nations, the
promotion of universal respect for and observance of human rights and
fundamental freedoms.''\cite{UniversalDeclerationOfHumanRights}. It appears that
under this pledge Member States should strive to uphold `The Universal
Declaration of Human Rights' preamble and articles, Article 19 states

\begin{quotation} Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression;
  this right include freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek,
  receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of
  frontiers.  \cite{UniversalDeclerationOfHumanRights}
\end{quotation}

again)

\subparagraph{Internet Police}

%reasons they claim they shutdown

\subsubsection{Does Tor promote freedom of expression?}

It is important to take note of not only the actions that taken or in this case
what Tor software has done and provides users but the driving ethos behind the
project by the projects maintainers, The Tor Project.

\paragraph{Tor Projects's Ethos}

The organization that actively maintains Tor takes their software and mission
versy seriously. It can be seen in The Tor Project's Mission Statement


\begin{quotation} 
  
  ``The Tor project is based on the belief that anonymity is not just a good
  idea some of the time — it is a requirement for a free and functioning
  society.''\cite{Tor:Users}

\end{quotation}



%tor project's claim of goals
%

\paragraph{Tor and Free Speech}

Tor is created such that anonymity is not in policy but in design as well. This
anonymity allows users to have unrestricted access to the internet. The other
benefits of the software prevent anonyone along the path to a server to not know
the source and destination at the same time. These properties of Tor make it a
lot harder for 3rd parties like the Iranian government to filter and monitor
network traffic of Tor users.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has taken it upon themselves to
endorse Tor. Under an EFF article titled `Surveillance Self-Defense' lists Tor
as a tool that can help you, ``protect the confidentiality of your
communications.''\cite{EFF:Tor} The Tor network requires the participation
of members of the network to create a more usable network. The EFF created `The
EFF Tor Challenge' to help support this network by having people volunteer and
hosting a Tor relay.\cite{EFF:TorChallenge} The goal was 500 relays and as of 
now 549 relays have been put up.\cite{EFF:TorChallenge}

Tor with its anonymity by design and support from organizations like the EFF
allow for Iranian dissidents to communicate freely. Tor removes the restrictions
that government's firewall imposes and allows users to freely access any
website. Tor also removes the ability for the Iranian government to monitor
users allowing them to freely associate and communicate with whom they wish. 

(mutual knowledge quote Free Software award)

\subsubsection{What is the financial cost of Tor?}

We should examine the financial costs of Tor not only in the direct payment of
the software but it's indirect costs by being open-source.\footnote{This section
  will only examine a topical and broad analysis of financial issues regarding
  Iranian dissidents since a full analysis of the financial state of the average
  Iranian dissident and those who use Tor probably could be an entire paper in
it itself.}

\paragraph{Tor in Regards to Beer}

To download and use Tor and the Tor network does not cost the user anything. By
making Tor free it does not discriminate on those who can `use' and those who
`cannot use' the software. 

It is fair to assume that some dissidents in Iran for one reason or another may
not have had the money to afford Tor if did cost anything. With Tor financial
barrier removed and the possible legitemate concerns of Iranian dissidents who
may not be able to afford Tor with a pricetag maximizes the number of dissidents
using Tor.

\paragraph{Tor in Regards to Speech}
(help protesters in iran - run a tor relay)

Tor is `open source', which means anyone can ``(redistribute) and use in source and
binary forms, with or without modification, (is) permitted provided that ...'' 
Tor's 3-clause BSD license conditions are met. \cite{BSD:3-ClauseLicense,
TOR:Download, TOR:BSD-License} 

By Tor being distributed as `open source' source code enable some inherent
qualities. It allows the source code for open review, which allows for anyone to
check for design or implementation flaws in the source code. In regards to this
case it allows Iranian dissidents to directly or by prox check for flaws in code
so they can trust that Tor actually provides anonimyty from the Iranian
government when they use Tor. This freedom also allows for anyone to modify the
code to the Tor Project arrised by local issues or to modify the code to meet
specific issues to local issues. For Iranian dissidents this means that if ther
was unique censorship tools or modifications to the Internet within Iran they
have a code base to operate from to modify the code to their local issue.
Indirectly by Tor being `open source' makes it financially beneficial to Iranian
dissidents.

\subsubsection{The State of Physical Oppression of Dissidents}
Before we investigate wether Tor addresses physical oppression of dissidents in
Iran we need to examine what the current sate of physical oppression is.
\footnote{We will begin examining Iran's state of oppression with the beginning
of protests in response to Iran's 2009 presidential elections because this
appears origin of what is relevant to this paper.}

\paragraph{Jail}

%number total protesters jailed
%places off limits for protesting

\paragraph{Death}

``Why is it that in our country political prisoners go to jail vertically but return
horizontally?'', Iranian MP, Ahmed Bakhshayes, asked the Iranian Parliament on
November 14, 2012.\cite{IranBloggersDeath} The Iranian government has been
responding to political dissidence in a fair amount of situations  putting
dissidents to death. For the past 10 years at least 18 people have died in while
imprisoned by the Iranian government, including the Iranian-Canadian
photographer Zahra Kazemi, student activist Amir Javadifar and journalist Hoda
Saber and most recently a 35 year old blogger Sattar Beheshti.
\cite{IranBloggersDeath}

%specific blogger killed
%addressed other bloggers jailed and killed

\subsubsection{Does Tor software mitigate Iran's physical oppression of
dissidents?}

Let us call a spade a spade, Tor is not a `silver bullet' for the physical
oppression going on in Iran. It however does have privacy by design. This does
make it much more challenging for the Iranian government to censor and monitor
Iranian dissidents. By Tor giving the empowering Iranian dissidents to
communicate in privacy and possibly journalize the events and their opinions of
Iranian current events, it prevents the Iranian government corelate the
vocalized opinions it disagrees with and whom are saying thim. In this veil of
secrecy is what indirectly helps Iranian dissidents from physical oppression.

\subsubsection{Was Tor ethical under SE code 3.03?}


\subsection{SE Code 1.07} 

\fbox{
  \parbox{0.8\linewidth}{
    1.07. Consider issues ...  and \textbf{other factors} that can
    \textbf{diminish access} to the \textbf{benefits} of \textbf{software}. 
    \cite{SE:CodeOfEthics}
}}
\newline

By the the Tor project releasing a patch on September 14 the same day that Iran
added filters to block out Tor traffic in their firewall meant that they
that the Tor Project was directly responding to the current events of Iran.

To bring this ethical argument into the domain of the research question a few
modifications to the code need to meade. The phrase \textbf{other factors} in
this case is \textbf{Iran's firewall block of Tor}. The phrase \textbf{diminish
access} in this case \textbf{prevents access}. The word \textbf{benefits} in
this case is the \textbf{uncensored Internet}. The word \textbf{software} in this
case is \textbf{Tor}.

\subsubsection{Applying SE Code 1.07 to the Tor Project}

\fbox{ 
  \parbox{0.8\linewidth}{

    \textbf{preventents access} to the \textbf{uncensored Internet} from 
    \textbf{Tor}.
    \cite{SE:CodeOfEthics}
}}
\newline

Our question now can be broken down into three parts. First, how did Tor
circumvent Iran's firewall? Second, how did the Tor software patch affect
uncensored Internet access?  Lastly was Tor ethical under SE Code 1.07?

\subsubsection{Iran's Firewall}
Before we investigate how Tor bypasses Iran's firewall or the considerations and
effects of the Tor patch we need to examine how Iran's firewall works.

\paragraph{Internet Service}

All of the Internet service in Iran is controlled by Data Communications of Iran
(DCI).\cite{FindingWayAroundIranianCensorship} In addition to DCI's monopoly on
Iran's internet it is mainly owned by the Iranian
government.\cite{FindingWayAroundIranianCensorship, DCI:Articles} With the
current setup this gives DCI and subsiquently the Iranian government the ability
to throttle the total amount of data that enters and leaves the country,
specifying what websites are accessable by defining filter rules on their
routers, and to turn off the Internet all
together.\cite{FindingWayAroundIranianCensorship}

\paragraph{Censorship} 

It is one thing for the Iranian government to ability to control over the Iran's
Internet but does it act on their power and actually censor and monitor DCI's
Internet users? In 2009 DCI for a brief period took down the entire Internet for
Iran. \cite{FindingWayAroundIranianCensorship} Specific websites such a
Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, and Google have been blocked from access.
\cite{FindingWayAroundIranianCensorship, IransElectronicCurtain} The blocking of
these sites does not just block what Iran's government may consider illegitimate
use of such websites, it  blocks legitimate use of these sites by Iranians and
those whom they may be trying to communicate with with these sites under Iran's
ethical framework. The Iranian government also took measures to filter SSL
traffic and specifically the Tor network.  \cite{Tor:IranPartiallyBlocksSSL,
IranBlocksTorSameDayFix} Blocking SSL traffic may appear just a means for the
government to filter and monitor Internet traffic but it has larger
implications. SSL traffic is fundemental and similar technologies is fundmental
for Internet users to protect themselves from malicious people from gathering
sensative information like passwords, banking informations, and meidical
information. Given the Iranian's power over DCI and there past and current
actions they have taken to exercise that power demonstrates that they want to
control the information and communications of its people and especially Iranian
dissidents.

\paragraph{Monitorship}

%Iran's Firewall could be considered not to be just passive access controls on
%the Internet but active response to what is being posted and discussed on the
%Internet. Iran's Internet Police, FATA....

%current setup ability to censor and monitor, internet police that monitors
%internet uses and, case examples of censoring communications, SSL traffic,
%faceboook, youtube, and this paper - tor

\subsubsection{How did Tor circumvent Iran's firewall?}

Now that we have an understanding what the Iranian firewall is capable it is
important to examing how Tor is capable of bypassing it.

\paragraph{How Tor Works}
\label{HowTorWorks}
We will examine how tor works by analogy of sending and receiving mail with
exchagned by people. 
\footnote{The reason for an explanation with analogy is to avoid the prequisite
  knowledge of computing and computer networks. For additional information on how 
  Tor works visit 
  \url{https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en#overview} and
  \url{http://freehaven.net/anonbib/}
}
We will define a \textbf{Tor node} as a \textbf{person}, \textbf{data} as a
\textbf{letter}, \textbf{encryption} as \textbf{an envelope}, and
\textbf{directory server} as \textbf{address book}.  Tor in this analogy works
by following the steps as follows. Bill wants to send a letter his friend Alice
and prevent anyone to read his message and to discover what his address.  Bill
is smart so he devises plan. He looks through his address book to find three
friends and their addresses.  When he finds three friends (Zulu, Yankee, X-ray)
they have agreed that they will forward any message that they receive to the
specified address. So he decides a path for letter to take take from one friend
to the next to reach Alice. In this analogy it will go from Zulu to Yankee to
X-ray and finally Alice. Before Bill does anything else he a exchanges a unique
means for each envelope to only be able to be opened by the receipient of that
letter.  Then he takes his letter addressed to Alice from Bob and then begins to
puts it in the first envelope states From Yankee to X-ray.  Then Bob puts first
envelop into a second enevelope from Zulu to Yankee.  Finally puts the second
envelope inside a third envelope addressed from Bill to Zulu.  Then he sends
this blob off to Zulu.  As each friend receives the envelope addressed to them
they open it and send it off to the friend it is stated on the envelope.  This
way, no one along the path from Bill to Alice knows the source address of of
Bill and the destination address of Alice at the same time except for Bill.  The
only ones who can read the message is X-ray and Alice. This is basically how Tor
software works. It should be noted to put an envelope around the original letter
before they are encased by the enevelopes for Zulu, Yankee, and X-ray is out of
the scope of the Tor protocol but could be coordinated between Bill and Alice.

\paragraph{Dousing the Firewall}

Continuing from the analogy above, we can analyze how Bill (i.e an Iranian
dissident) could use this technique to subvert the access controls specified by
the Iranan firewall. Iranian dicidents being able to use Tor to connect to the
Tor network would connect other Tor nodes and set up a path. Tor could be
specified to make sur the last node in the path, the exit node, is outside Iran.
\cite{Tor:SpecificExitNode, Tor:FAQ} The data being sent across the designated
path would reach its end address (e.g.  Twitter, Facebook) and Iran's firewall
would not be able to censor or monitor that data. The Iranian government
wouldn't be able to censor what websites the Iranian dissident wants to access
since the firewall doesn't know the end address. The Iranian government wouldn't
be able to monitor Iranian dissidents traffic since all along the path in Iran
since the data is encrypted.  However Iran could and has blocked Tor traffic
itself.

\subsubsection{Did The Tor Project consider the release of the Tor patch?} 

At this point we can examine the consideration The Tor Project's made for the
release of Tor 0.2.2.33 and 0.2.3.4-alpha. There was virtually no data found on
the on a consideration to release this specific patch. The next best thing we
can do is to infer a consideration of this patch by looking at information that
plausibly would factor into the consideration of releasing this software. To do
this we shall look at the technical and social topics surrounding this release
that could have impacted the decision process of release.

\paragraph{Quality}

The Tor Project takes Tor and the Tor network very seriously and critically.
They openly admit that their software is not perfect by any means. Despite this
there has been considerable amounts of academic and government research on
anonymity networks and revision of the Tor project. \cite{Tor:ResearchPapers}
Tor's source code and design documents are fully open to the public to review
and scrutinize, they even ask on The Tor Project's 'Research Ideas' web-page
that, ``we need people to attack the system, quantify defenses, etc.''
\cite{Tor:ResearchIdeas, Tor:2011} Since open source code and design documents
might not be enough  they provide a growing repository of tools to take metrics
and attack the Tor network. \cite{Tor:ResearchHome} ``DEFINE SECURE SOFTWARE''.
It appears that The Tor Project does its best to meet this definition of
security for their users.  

\paragraph{Tor Is Blocked}

The Iranian government September 14th, 2011 added a filter to their 'firewall'
that blocked Tor traffic. They were able to do this by checking Tor's expiration
time of SSL session certificates. This was possible because at the Time Tor's
SSL session certificates were set to expire after 2 hours where normal SSL
certificats would usually last a year or more. For a short period of time this
effectively blocked Iranian dicidents who used Tor from receiving its benefits
of an uncensored Internet. \cite{IranBlocksTorSameDayFix}

\paragraph{The Patch} 

The Tor Project was able to fix this within the same day by changing the
certificates to have a, ``larger expiration time ..., so our certs have more
plausible expiry times.'' \cite{IranBlocksTorSameDayFix} There appeared to be
nothing written about considering technical and social issues specifically
related to the release of Tor 0.2.2.33 and 0.2.3.4-alpha.  However it was
implied in the blog post \textit{Iran blocks Tor; Tor releases same-day fix} by
phobos that the patch was a simple fix. \cite{IranBlocksTorSameDayFix} From this
it would be fair to assume that change in the software did not drastically
change the robustness of the software from the prior version and therefore did
not put any users in any new danger.

\paragraph{Social Issues}

With the Iranian government killing, jailing, and generally harrasing Iranian
dissidents it is a good idea that Iranian dissidents make it as hard as possible
to prevent themselves from falling subject to the regime of their government.
Tor while not perfect does its best to give its users the benefit of anonymity
and an uncensored Internet. It is not unreasonable to think that The Tor Project
believes that Iranian dissidents are better off using there software then not to
use any anonymity software at all. So in regards to the release of the patch it
was probably obvious to The Tor Project that the software be patched as timely
as possible and released for use. safer for Iranian dissidents to use Tor than
to not use anything.

\paragraph{The Censorship Arms Race}

Iran's attempt to block Tor was noted in 

\paragraph{Consideration}

From what we have established, it is probably fair to say that we can infer an
approximate idea of what The Tor Project was considering during this patch.
Since the Tor patch was considered a minimal change to the current robust code
base, there probably was little to no fear about the update patch causing a
negative technical issue and resulting in a diminished asccess to the uncensored
Internet.  In regards to the social issues pausibly preventing the release of
the patch, The Tor Project probably felt that it would be definitely that
Iranian dissidents would be better off by result of them releasing the patch.

\section{Conclusion} 


Roger Dingledine during a talk about Tor last year stated that, ``it should not
be up to me how China changes, we write tools
to let people all around the world change the world in the way they think their
world needs to change.'' \cite{Tor:28c3} Under both of these
tenents of the SE Code, we can conclude that The Tor Project was ethical in
releasing a same day patch enabling Iranians to bypass Iran's firewall when the
government explicitely filtered Tor traffic starting September 14, 2011.
