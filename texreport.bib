  % China’s system of Internet censorship and surveillance, popularly

  %    149-page report, Human Rights Watch documents how extensive corporate and
  %    private sector cooperation – including by some of the world’s major
  %    Internet companies – enables this system of censorship. Research was
  %    performed through interviews and extensive testing of search engines in
  %    China, and includes 18 screen shots to illustrate examples of censorship.
  %    The report vividly illustrates how various companies, including Yahoo!,
  %  Microsoft, Google, and Skype block terms they believe the Chinese government
  %    will want them to censor. (From the Human Rights Watch Website)
